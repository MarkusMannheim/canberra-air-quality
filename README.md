# Canberra's air quality

[This chart](https://markusmannheim.github.io/canberra-air-quality/) shows average hourly air-quality data from the ACT Government's [three monitoring stations](https://www.health.act.gov.au/about-our-health-system/population-health/environmental-monitoring/monitoring-and-regulating-air-7). It measures fine particles (PM2.5) in the air, which are the most harmful to health.

The Government also provides [health advice](https://www.health.act.gov.au/about-our-health-system/population-health/environmental-monitoring/monitoring-and-regulating-air-0#air-quality-table) about PM2.5 levels. I recommend reading it before making assumptions about what the numbers in this chart mean.
